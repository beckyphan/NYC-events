# NYC::Events

Welcome to New York!

This gem scrapes the TIMEOUT New York website to give a quick list of events happening this week. The webpage is updated weekly, so running this gem will provide current events.

It providers a command line interface for users to pull events happening this week.
A list of events will be provided, in which users can select an event to learn more--including the event description, dates, etc.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'NYC-events'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install NYC-events
