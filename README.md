# NYC::Events

Welcome to New York!

This gem scrapes NYC.com to give a quick list of events happening today. The webpage is updated daily, so running this gem should always provide current events.

A list of events will be provided, in which users can select an event to learn more--including the event description, dates, etc.
Users can also create lists and collect/add events to specific lists they have created for viewing later.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'NYC-events'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install NYC-events

## Usage

Use this gem to scrape events from NYC.com & create/save lists of events happening in New York City.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
