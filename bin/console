# run CLI file
# display events happening today
# ready to run a 'display more' & scrape more
# user can type exit to exit
# user can go one-level deep & select event to read event details
# user can create a list to add event to a list

# MY NEXT STEPS
# user can view lists and the collected events in each list
# user can review events in lists/list_options
# update readme, confirm that it scrapes today's events vs tomorrow's events?
# review all repository files -- are all files necessary?
